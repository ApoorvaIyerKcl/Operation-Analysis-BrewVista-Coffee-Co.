# BrewVista Coffee Co. 

**Executive Summary**

**Retail sales data** is most valuable when it directly supports **business decision-making** rather than remaining as **raw transaction logs**. This project analyses **transactional sales data** from a **coffee retail business** to help **sales and marketing teams** understand **revenue drivers**, **customer demand patterns**, and **location-level performance**.  

Using **Microsoft Excel**, the dataset was **cleaned**, **structured**, and **analysed** through **pivot tables** and **dashboards**. The final output enables **stakeholders** to identify **high-performing products**, **peak demand periods**, and **regional performance differences**, supporting informed decisions around **inventory planning**, **staffing alignment**, and **promotional strategy**.


**Business Problem**

The **coffee business** captures a large volume of **transaction-level sales data** across **products**, **store locations**, and **time periods**. However, the **raw data** does not clearly answer questions required for effective **sales and marketing planning**.  

**Key challenges included:**

1. Limited clarity on **revenue-driving products**
2. Difficulty identifying **demand fluctuations** across **months** and **peak hours**
3. Lack of visibility into **location-level performance differences**
4. No structured understanding of **customer preferences** by **product size**.

As a result, **planning decisions** related to **inventory**, **staffing**, and **promotions** were often driven by **intuition rather than data**.

**Methodology**

1. Cleaned and standardised the original combined coffee shop sales dataset of **1,40,000+ rows** and **28 columns** to ensure consistency across products, sizes, dates, and locations.
2. Built **10 pivot tables to aggregate sales revenue, order volume, and customer demand across products, time periods, store locations, sales channels,** and **product sizes**.
3. Designed an interactive Excel dashboard using pivot charts and slicers to enable self-serve analysis for sales and marketing stakeholders.
 
**Skills**

1. Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and structuring, Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, Slicers and business-focused data visualisation
2. Analytical Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers, Translating data into actionable insights
3. Business Skills: Stakeholder-oriented analysis, Performance tracking and reporting, Insight-driven recommendations

**Results & Business Recommendations**

1. The **Excel dashboard** gave **sales and marketing teams** a consolidated, self-serve view across **products**, **time periods**, **store locations**, and **product sizes**.  
2. A small set of **products drives most sales revenue**, and **monthly trends** follow predictable **demand patterns**.  
3. **Peak sales hours** revealed opportunities to better **align staffing with demand**.  
4. The business should **prioritise high-performing products** and **review underperforming locations** to improve overall **sales performance**.


**Next Steps**

With additional time and data, the analysis could be extended in the following ways:
Incorporate cost data to evaluate profitability in greater detail
Analyse customer behaviour to identify repeat purchasing patterns
